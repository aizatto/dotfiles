" <CTRL>+TAB to cycle through tabs, seems to only work in GVIM
noremap <C-Tab> gt

" Create a new tab
noremap <C-W>tn :tabnew<CR>

"" Use <Ctrl>+N or <CTRL>+P to cycle through tabs:
nnoremap <C-N> gt
nnoremap <C-P> gT

" have <F1> prompt for a help topic, rather than displaying the introduction
" page, and have it do this from any mode:
nnoremap <F1> :help<Space>

" Disable Ex Mode!
nnoremap <S-Q> <Esc>

" For those quick fingers, which can't release the shift key.
nmap :W :w
nmap :Q :q
